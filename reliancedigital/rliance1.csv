Mini‑LEDs. To achieve extremely high brightness, we used an array of LEDs across the entire back of the display. To fit them in the incredibly thin iPad Pro, we used custom‑designed mini‑LEDs that are 120 times smaller than in previous generations. Custom‑sized optical films and diffusers mix the light more efficiently and fit in a design that’s just 6.4-millimetre thin.

Local dimming zones. Over 10,000 mini‑LEDs are grouped into more than 2,500 local dimming zones. Depending on the content, the brightness in each zone can be precisely adjusted to achieve an astonishing 10,00,000:1 contrast ratio. Even the most detailed HDR content with the finest specular highlights — like galaxies and action movie explosions — are more true to life than ever.

Powered by over 10,000 mini‑LEDs
Mini‑LEDs. To achieve extremely high brightness, we used an array of LEDs across the entire back of the display. To fit them in the incredibly thin iPad Pro, we used custom‑designed mini‑LEDs that are 120 times smaller than in previous generations. Custom‑sized optical films and diffusers mix the light more efficiently and fit in a design that’s just 6.4-millimetre thin.

Local dimming zones. Over 10,000 mini‑LEDs are grouped into more than 2,500 local dimming zones. Depending on the content, the brightness in each zone can be precisely adjusted to achieve an astonishing 10,00,000:1 contrast ratio. Even the most detailed HDR content with the finest specular highlights — like galaxies and action movie explosions — are more true to life than ever.

Powered by over 10,000 mini‑LEDs
Mini‑LEDs. To achieve extremely high brightness, we used an array of LEDs across the entire back of the display. To fit them in the incredibly thin iPad Pro, we used custom‑designed mini‑LEDs that are 120 times smaller than in previous generations. Custom‑sized optical films and diffusers mix the light more efficiently and fit in a design that’s just 6.4-millimetre thin.

Over 2,500 local dimming zones
Local dimming zones. Over 10,000 mini‑LEDs are grouped into more than 2,500 local dimming zones. Depending on the content, the brightness in each zone can be precisely adjusted to achieve an astonishing 10,00,000:1 contrast ratio. Even the most detailed HDR content with the finest specular highlights — like galaxies and action movie explosions — are more true to life than ever.

Powered by over 10,000 mini‑LEDs
Mini‑LEDs. To achieve extremely high brightness, we used an array of LEDs across the entire back of the display. To fit them in the incredibly thin iPad Pro, we used custom‑designed mini‑LEDs that are 120 times smaller than in previous generations. Custom‑sized optical films and diffusers mix the light more efficiently and fit in a design that’s just 6.4-millimetre thin.

Local dimming zones. Over 10,000 mini‑LEDs are grouped into more than 2,500 local dimming zones. Depending on the content, the brightness in each zone can be precisely adjusted to achieve an astonishing 10,00,000:1 contrast ratio. Even the most detailed HDR content with the finest specular highlights — like galaxies and action movie explosions — are more true to life than ever.

Liquid Retina XDR display. Best and brightest.
Extreme dynamic range on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. The Liquid Retina XDR display delivers true-to-life detail with a 10,00,000:1 contrast ratio, great for viewing and editing HDR photos and videos, or enjoying your favourite movies and TV shows. It also features a breathtaking 1,000 nits of full‑screen brightness and 1,600 nits of peak brightness along with advanced display technologies like P3 wide colour, True Tone and ProMotion. And you can use Reference Mode for a more colour-accurate workflow.

Powered by over 10,000 mini‑LEDs
Mini‑LEDs. To achieve extremely high brightness, we used an array of LEDs across the entire back of the display. To fit them in the incredibly thin iPad Pro, we used custom‑designed mini‑LEDs that are 120 times smaller than in previous generations. Custom‑sized optical films and diffusers mix the light more efficiently and fit in a design that’s just 6.4-millimetre thin.

Over 2,500 local dimming zones
Local dimming zones. Over 10,000 mini‑LEDs are grouped into more than 2,500 local dimming zones. Depending on the content, the brightness in each zone can be precisely adjusted to achieve an astonishing 10,00,000:1 contrast ratio. Even the most detailed HDR content with the finest specular highlights — like galaxies and action movie explosions — are more true to life than ever.

Powered by over 10,000 mini‑LEDs
Mini‑LEDs. To achieve extremely high brightness, we used an array of LEDs across the entire back of the display. To fit them in the incredibly thin iPad Pro, we used custom‑designed mini‑LEDs that are 120 times smaller than in previous generations. Custom‑sized optical films and diffusers mix the light more efficiently and fit in a design that’s just 6.4-millimetre thin.

Over 2,500 local dimming zones
Local dimming zones. Over 10,000 mini‑LEDs are grouped into more than 2,500 local dimming zones. Depending on the content, the brightness in each zone can be precisely adjusted to achieve an astonishing 10,00,000:1 contrast ratio. Even the most detailed HDR content with the finest specular highlights — like galaxies and action movie explosions — are more true to life than ever.

Mini‑LEDs. To achieve extremely high brightness, we used an array of LEDs across the entire back of the display. To fit them in the incredibly thin iPad Pro, we used custom‑designed mini‑LEDs that are 120 times smaller than in previous generations. Custom‑sized optical films and diffusers mix the light more efficiently and fit in a design that’s just 6.4-millimetre thin.

Local dimming zones. Over 10,000 mini‑LEDs are grouped into more than 2,500 local dimming zones. Depending on the content, the brightness in each zone can be precisely adjusted to achieve an astonishing 10,00,000:1 contrast ratio. Even the most detailed HDR content with the finest specular highlights — like galaxies and action movie explosions — are more true to life than ever.

Liquid Retina XDR display. Best and brightest.
Extreme dynamic range on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. The Liquid Retina XDR display delivers true-to-life detail with a 10,00,000:1 contrast ratio, great for viewing and editing HDR photos and videos, or enjoying your favourite movies and TV shows. It also features a breathtaking 1,000 nits of full‑screen brightness and 1,600 nits of peak brightness along with advanced display technologies like P3 wide colour, True Tone and ProMotion. And you can use Reference Mode for a more colour-accurate workflow.

Powered by over 10,000 mini‑LEDs
Mini‑LEDs. To achieve extremely high brightness, we used an array of LEDs across the entire back of the display. To fit them in the incredibly thin iPad Pro, we used custom‑designed mini‑LEDs that are 120 times smaller than in previous generations. Custom‑sized optical films and diffusers mix the light more efficiently and fit in a design that’s just 6.4-millimetre thin.

Over 2,500 local dimming zones
Local dimming zones. Over 10,000 mini‑LEDs are grouped into more than 2,500 local dimming zones. Depending on the content, the brightness in each zone can be precisely adjusted to achieve an astonishing 10,00,000:1 contrast ratio. Even the most detailed HDR content with the finest specular highlights — like galaxies and action movie explosions — are more true to life than ever.
